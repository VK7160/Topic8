            This basic column chart compares rainfall values between four states of India in the year 2021.
            Meghalaya has the overall highest amount of rainfall, followed by Kerala due to the presence of the moist natural
            environment in the surroundings. The chart is making use of the axis crosshair feature, to highlight months as they are hovered
            over.
